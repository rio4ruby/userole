# Userole

Userole is an easy to use Ruby on Rails application with limited functionality for viewing and managing
Users and Roles written in response to a programming challenge.

### The Challange

> Create a simple-to-use Ruby on Rails web application to maintain user passwords and security roles each user may possess.
> It should display the list of users and roles they possess in a table.
> It should also allow the application user to change a user's password.
> We only need three roles and three users.
> The roles and passwords must be persisted to storage to be used next time the application is run.
